Work on your Video.  The video should inform us about something that is important to you.  
It could be about your family, a favorite activity, a sport that you are involved in, a friend 
group that supports you, an instrument that you play, or a volunteering job that you do 
(to name just a few ideas).  NO PETS (I'm sure they're cute, but they don't tell me much about YOU).  
If your idea is not on the list provided, check in with me first.

Use your timeline (created on Tuesday, 2/7/23) to get to work.

Here are some requirements for your video:

    Exactly 90 seconds long (no more, no less)
    A maximum of 60 megabytes
    At least 30 seconds of your video must be "true video", not just screen capture.
    No audio is allowed
    At least 9 text boxes must be used through the course of your video

Use the video editing software that you feel most comfortable with.  I have included a couple 
of links to tutorials for popular video editing software, but you are not limited to these 
software titles; choose what works for you.
